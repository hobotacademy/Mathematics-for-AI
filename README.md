## 🏛️ The Foundations of Intelligence
Mathematics is not just a prerequisite; it's the language of AI. This repository bridges the gap between abstract theorems and executable code. For every concept, we provide:
1.  **Comprehensive Notes:** Theoretical foundations and mathematical proofs.
2.  **From Scratch Implementations:** Building algorithms using only `NumPy` to master the internal logic.
3.  **Library-Based Practice:** Leveraging industry-standard tools for professional application.

## 🛠️ Curriculum & Session Roadmap

The repository is structured into intensive phases based on our official syllabus:

### Phase 1: Linear Algebra & Matrix Mechanics
* **S00 - S02:** Matrix & Vector Fundamentals, Inverting Matrices.
* **S03 - S04:** Matrix Decomposition, Eigenvalues, and Eigenvectors.
* **S05 - S06:** **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** implementation from scratch.

### Phase 2: Calculus & Optimization (The Training Engine)
* **S07 - S08:** Calculus Foundations and Finding Critical Points.
* **S09 - S10:** **Gradient Descent (GD)** and Multiple Regression mechanics.

### Phase 3: Probability & Bayesian Theory
* **S11 - S12:** Probability Fundamentals and Logistic Regression logic.
* **S13 - S14:** Naive Bayes Classifier and **Bayesian Filtering**.

### Phase 4: Statistics & Data Distributions
* **S15 - S17:** Expectations, Variances, and the **Normal Distribution**.
* **S18 - S19:** Descriptive Statistics for data storytelling.
